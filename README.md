# SPI-interface-with-MCP3202-ADC
hello
https://www.edaplayground.com/x/hZj4  
Designed an SPI controller in Verilog to interface with the MCP3202 ADC, which samples analog input signals and converts them into 12-bit digital values. The converted data is received by the FPGA through this SPI controller.

MCP3202

DIN - input from spi controller(mosi).
DOUT - output from MCP3202 ADC output given to spi controller miso pin.
